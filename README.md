## Project Requirements and Features List
### Get Started
When a user first registers an account with Elephant Room they will be taken to a form and will be prompted to create a profile automatically as they become a user. This gives them a base to approach the application, your profile is your personal creation and the topics and categories you will associate to the user.

### Categories and Topics
Once a user has created an account they will be routed to their personal profile page, here they can edit some of their preferences and presented material.
